# Project Title

Residue Adjacency Matrix for Solving Cysteine Redox States

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python 3
Numpy for Python 3
SKLearn for Python3
Matplotlib for Python3
```

## Running the tests

Once you have installed the prerequisites then simply run

```
python3 RSC758.py

python3 BALOSCTdb.py

python3 OSCTdb.py
```

### Break down into end to end tests

The above will give you the replicated results that are quoted in the paper.
